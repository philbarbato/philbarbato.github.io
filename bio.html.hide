      <p>Hi there! My name is Phil. I've been making things for the Internet since the turn of the century. I'm currently working at a small marketing firm where I do full-stack development and other odd jobs like business development, videography, and photography.</p>

      <p>I have done the following brilliant things: Scoped and won over $500,000 in contracts; Created web design and development curriculum for colleagues; and built a starter-file repository to streamline development. I am looking for a job that (*has these amazing features.*)</p>

      <p>I am an artist on the side too, and once came pretty close to selling stuffed animals full-time. I don't miss it. Mostly. I paint, make music, and build things. I don't have any free time anymore, but if I did, you'd probably find me either under the hood of my car, or trying to build some furniture without gluing my fingers together or sawing them off.</p>
